# NYC Bike Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to examine the Citibike program in New York to then determine how well the same sort of program would work for the city of Des Moines, Iowa.  The purpose of using New York is to show how the Des Moines bike sharing program could work and how it could be successful.


## Results

The above graphs show checkout times of all users by hour and minute as well as by gender.  A larger number of the users by gender are male as compared to female and the number of people who did not fill out the gender section of an online form.

These two visualizations are showing trips during days of the week by the hour for all users and user type during the week split by gender.  In the user type by weekday by gender heatmap a large number of subscribers who are female use bikes on Thursday and Friday.  This could mean that for the later days of the week female subscribers will use the bikes more often.  Also, when looking at the week trips heatmap there is also a large number of people who use bikes around 5pm on multiple days during the week.  This very likely could be explained by rush hour bike usage at the end of the day.

This heatmap shows the trips during the week but by gender.  On the female side of the heatmap it is very clear that women are using the bikes during the week.  Whereas men do not seem to be using them at all.  Similar to the week trips for all users between 5 and 7pm women are using the bikes more often than men are.

As part of this story it is clear that during specific hours of the day women are using citibikes more frequently than men are.  Along with that it would also be a good idea to know which bikes are being used the most as these are the ones that will need to be repaired first.  Knowing that will help to understand just how much cost will go into repairing the bike but also how many bikes at a time will likely need to be repaired.

This chart also shows the peak usage hours in the month of August.  This may feel redundant to the first several graphs and heatmaps shown however this helps for another purpose.  Knowing the bikes to be repaired is one thing but knowing when the most bikes are used is also needed.  This way a schedule of when the repairs should take place can be worked out.  This way the bikes to be repaired can be done so in the non-peak hours and then during peak hours the most number of bikes can be utilized.


## Summary

### Results Summary
The main takeaways from this analysis are that in order for a bike sharing program there has to be enough users to want to use the bikes.  Beyond that knowing the bikes that will get used the most and at what hours of the day will also help to understand how best to keep the bikes maintained.  Looking back to the data itself there is a clear difference between men using the bikes and women using the bikes.  Based off of this analysis when broken down to specific days of the week women appear to be using the bikes more often at specific hours of the day.  This only seems to be true of August because thats when the data is from.  An analysis of other months would have to be done or an entire year to see the usage over a longer period of time.

### Additional Visualizations
One visualization that could be done in addition to these is to see the peak usage over an entire year.  Is August the month where peak usage during the year is highest.  It would also give someone an idea of what to expect in terms of usage traffic in all the months of the year.  August is a great time of year in both New York City and Des Moines, however, in January and Febuary people are not as likely because it could be cold.  So seeing how many people are likely to use the bikes in those months would be helpful.

A second visualization that would be interesting would be bike utilization by user type.  It would be interesting to see if those who are using the bikes are subscribers or just simply customers.  It is very likely that customers are tourists who want to use the bikes compared with the subscribers who could be people who live here in New York and its far more worth it to use the bike compared with the cost of cabs and ubers.
